Objective: 
1. Identify and examine three different websites which offer an online purchasing facility.
2. From this generic list, construct an Extended Entity Relationship (EER) diagram for a database that would support an on-line purchasing facility.
3. Using the software provided, build tables to represent the entities from the Table Schema.
4. Design five data retrieval queries for this database that demonstrate your skill with SQL and run them.


Key Tasks:
  1. Conducted requirement analysis, identifying key data fields and entities across different websites.
  2. Developed an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and normalized it to 3NF, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.
  3. Implemented the database schema, creating nine interrelated tables, including Customer, Product, Payment, Checkout, and Delivery.
  4.Executed SQL queries for data validation, retrieval, and analysis, optimizing the system for business use cases such as customer data management and delivery tracking.

Technologies Used: SQL, Database Design (ERD), Data Normalization (1NF to 3NF), MySQL/PostgreSQL (or specify the database system used).
